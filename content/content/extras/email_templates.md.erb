#### For PR

I am writing to invite you to participate as a "Product Reviewer" in a course I teach at Brandeis. The course is called "Capstone in Software Engineering" and it entails students building a complet "SaaS" product, from scratch, using Ruby on Rails, working in teams of 4 students. It's considered to be a very intensive course because we cover a lot of terrain very quickly. One of the key features are people I call "Product Reviewers (PR)" A PR is a person that I pair up with two teams of 4 or 5 students at key moments during the semster to hold them to a high standard, give them some coaching and encouragement.

If you participate, I will ask you to meet with the students 3 times during the semester, 1 hour with each team. I know you have deep experience in some aspect of software engineering and development. Ruby and Rails knowledge is not required at all. You will take on the role kind of like a CTO getting briefed by a development team. You follow your own instincts about what advice or challenges you want to place before your team. I believe it will come quite naturally to you and require no preparation.

The schedule is that each PR spends around 1.5 hours with each of 2 teams, three times during the semester, beginning in early October and then 1 month apart for the next two. The team will schedule the meetings with you once we get a little closer. I provide a room for you to meet with the students, and ask that you meet within +/- 1 week of the start of the semester. After the meeting, I ask you for a simple email feedback after the meeting.

I am glad to give you any additional details to help you make a judgement. Here’s the course web site for you to peruse: http://cosi166b.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com

The feedback I get in general from the PRs is that they like it and have a lot of fun doing it. You would be providing a valuable experience to the next generation of software engineers.And for the students it’s usually the top feature of the course! So I really hope you consider it!!

I know that your schedule is full and this is just extra so if you need to decline this is totally understandable. And if you can’t do it, maybe someone you work with would love to do it. Please let me hear from you when you can!

#### For Judge

I am writing to invite you to participate as a Judge for the Product Showcase we have to cap off the "Capstone in Software Engineering" course I am teaching at Brandeis.

... more needed...

#### For Guest Lecturer

The main goal is to have students hear and see someone from the real world explaining how stuff really works. They love it and usually it’s the top feature of the course.

Remember that these are in some cases freshmen, ranging all the way to grad students. You have to assume that they know nothing about business, have never had a real job. For ecxample, they don't know what words like revenue, corporation, financing, business model, etc, really mean

The course is about “Software Entrepreneurship” and I focus more than half the time on ways to validate products, “product/market fit” and so on. I also cover but in less detail pricing, business models, growth hacking, marketing and so on. I try to coordinate the timing of the guest lecture with when that topic is coming up in class.

So for you the topic could be around pricing and business models, or about selling in general, or something else that you could propose.

The class is around 40 students, with a combined lecture/discussion/project kind of approach. By the time you come around the students will have been divided up into teams of 4 and each team is working on validating a product idea that they have come up with as a result of a bunch of brainstorming. In this class they are not implementing the product, they are coming up with it, refining it, proving demand for it, identifying market segments and at the end they present their result (I don’t call it a business plan) to a panel of judges during a Sharktank-like final showcase.

You may have powerpoint if you want but it’s not required. The class goes for 80 minutes, so assuming 5 minutes intro by me, and 25 minutes for final open discussion and q&a you have around 50 minutes to play with. You can do less or more depending on your style.

How does that sound?

#### Initial general email

I am writing to see if you might be interested in participating in a course I am teaching again this year at Brandeis University. The course is called "Capstone in Software Engineering" and it entails students building a complete "SaaS" product, from scratch, using Ruby on Rails, working in teams of 4 students. It's considered to be a very intensive course because we cover a lot of terrain very quickly. You can read the nitty-gritty here: http://cosi166b.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com.

There are two different opportunities, being a "Product Reviewer" who meets three times for 1 hour each with a team during the semester to give them some sage advice and coaching. And the other is to be a Judge at the end of semester showcase. In previous years the feedback that I've gotten is that it was a lot of fun and rewarding and very little effort. Certainly no preparation wouldbe needed, just simply your knowledge and experience! On the other hand, it's happened more than once that connections were made with really bright students who ended up interning and even being hired!

I know your schedule is probably crazy so I understand if you decline, but I hope you will consider it. By the way, if you think you yourself is not the right person but you know someone else that might be interested, please let me know too.

Thanks, and please get back to me with your thoughts and we can set up the specific role and schedule.

Best,
