<%= homework_hdr %>

1. <%= partbadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> **RORT:** Read [Ruby on Rails Tutorial (\[RORT\])](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/beginning#cha-beginning) Chapter 10, "Updating, Showing and Deleting Users". **YES: We skipped a chapter.** In this chapter we continue developing the big example, by adding logic to update users. Now we gradually move from authentication to authorization, which in a way is much simpler. As usual I really encourage and ask you to go through the code samples and actually type them in. You will see that it really helps your understanding and will assure your success in this course! Use your resources: the TAs, the class mailing list, stack overflow, google and push through to success! When you are done, go to Latte and answer these warmup questions:
    * What is a before_action? Try to be precise (but the answer can be expressed in two sentences.)
    * What does this css selector do: `.users { ...`
    * What are "strong parameters" and what is their purpose? What security risk are they meant to combat?
    * Are there one or two things you are still confused by? Code that you've written which is pure magic and meaningless to you? If not, what one or two things were the most memorable about your reading? <%= deliverable "The usual drill: please respond to the questions and post as a pdf to Latte before 10:00am" %>

1. <%= partbadge %> <%= teambadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> **Weekly Team Update:** Submit your <%= link_to_topic :weekly_progress_updates %> according to the instructions. <%= team_deliverable "Weekly Progress Update" %>
