#### Important note about today
While the homework is required, you may use the class time today for working with your team on your project. You can do this if you feel that would be a better use of your time or you're not that interested in this topic. Just let me know ahead of time. **Note: This is not 80 minutes free time**:It is mandatory that you either come to class or work, face to face, with your team for the duration of class time.
