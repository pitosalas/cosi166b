#### Project Teams midcourse progress review!
This is not actually homework but a chance to catch up if you need it. Tomorrow the TAs and I will review your progress on your product up to now. This will count as 5% of the 35% of your grade for the product. The other 30% will come through based on your work from now forward. Progress scores will be based on:

* A high level review of all the code you have so far.
* Does it appear to be going in the right direction
* Does it show an understanding of the technology
* How much of a challenge you are taking on in the project plan
* Perceptions of your TA about your project
* Preparation and actual PR meetings, as reported by PR
* How well the team seems to be functioning,

#### Discussion about homework for today
* I know you're all in the trenches getting *anything* to work
* What did you think of the various articles and papers? Interesting?
* Some simple lessons you learned about UI
* How will they be applicable to your products?

<%= include_topic :ux_review_exercise %>

#### Conclusion

* I want you to always refer back to principles such as these when you design or present a user experience.
* It's very easy to say, "Oh it's common sense." But you submit designs that violate these principles left and right.
* It's important. Make it part of your toolkit. Internalize it! Take care!
