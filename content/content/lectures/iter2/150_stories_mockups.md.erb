<%= homework_hdr %>

1. <%= pdfbadge %> **Paper Prototype**: Read this paper about [Paper Prototyping](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/paperprototyping/). Design a paper prototype for your team's product.  Remember, this is an inidividual assignment, so that we can compare each team member's vision of what the product might be. We will assess your work based on the care and thought you put into it, not on whether the UI itself is awesome. <%= deliverable "Readable image of your paper prototype. If you just take a cell phone picture of a drawing in pencil (worst case) it will not be legible." %>
1. <%= partbadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> **RORT:** Read [Ruby on Rails Tutorial Chapter 5](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/beginning#cha-beginning) - "Filling in the layout. Here we see how to create views, and start seeing a lot of HTML and getting into routing at a greater level of detail. As usual I really encourage and ask you to go through the code samples and actually type them in. You will see that it really helps your understanding and will assure your success in this course! Use your resources: the TAs, the class mailing list, stack overflow, google and push through to success! When you are done, go to Latte and answer these warmup questions:
    * Give me your explanation on what `link_to` is and does. As specific as you can.
    * When and why would you use a partial?
    * What does he mean (in conclusion) by a custom routing rule?
    * Are there one or two things you are still confused by? If not, what one or two things were the most memorable about your reading? <%= deliverable "Do the warmup in Latte and submit by 10am on the day of class." %>
1. <%= zipbadge %> **PA Rails 1:** Complete work on <%= link_to_topic :pa_rails_1 %>. Work in your portfolio, in a directory called pa_rails. Submit your code as a zip file. <%= deliverable "Rails app as a zip file." %> Begin work on <%= link_to_topic :pa_rails_2 %>.
1. <%= partbadge %> <%= teambadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> **Weekly Team Update:** Submit your <%= link_to_topic :weekly_progress_updates %> according to the instructions. <%= team_deliverable "Weekly Progress Update" %>

##### Ongoing work
* **Project teams:** Even though there are no specific deliverables, you should be working on steps up to and around **PAPERPROT** from <%= link_to_section :intro, :project_roadmap %>. Not just during lab and during your meetings, but on your own. The sooner you kick into gear the better!
* **Rails PA 2** Working on <%= link_to_topic :pa_rails_2 %>. You can see the assigment and due dates here: <%= link_to_topic  :pa_rails_guide %>
