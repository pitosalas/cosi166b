1. <%= partbadge %> **Team Information**: Each team creates an entry on the Team Information Page, including: Project Name, TA Partner, Product Reviewer, Url to Trello, Url to your github, Url to your Heroku. <%= team_deliverable "Updated team information page" %>
1. <%= pdfbadge %> **Paper Prototype**: Read this paper about [Paper Prototyping](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/paperprototyping/). Design a paper prototype for your team's product.  Remember, this is an inidividual assignment, so that we can compare each team member's vision of what the product might be. We will assess your work based on the care and thought you put into it, not on whether the UI itself is awesome. <%= deliverable "Readable image of your paper prototype. If you just take a cell phone picture of a drawing in pencil (worst case) it will not be legible." %>
1. **Projects:** You should be working or completed steps **GIT, DOCUMENTATION, PLANSKEL, SHEMASKEL, BUILDSKEL, STORYSDV, PAPERSDV, SCHEMASDV**.
