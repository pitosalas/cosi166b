1. **Read** [The F35s terible bug list](http://www.defenseone.com/technology/2016/02/f-35s-terrifying-bug-list/125638/?oref=DefenseOneTCO) to see the real world impact that bugs have. Also tht Fighter jets are really computers with wings on them!
1. **Read** [There's more to Ruby Debugging than puts](https://engineering.shopify.com/17489080-theres-more-to-ruby-debugging-than-puts?utm_medium=email&utm_source=rubyweekly). Lots of very practical tips and ideas about debugging, as well as some really useful Ruby tricks.
1. **Read** [Test Doubles in Theory, in Minitest and Rspec](http://ieftimov.com/test-doubles-theory-minitest-rspec). Test doubles, mocks, and similar concepts are a powerful abstraction for independently testing complex subsystems. Of course we're using minitest, but rspec is a popular alternative test framework. Bottom line they are both quite similar to each other.

#### Discussion on yesterday's homework
* Did you really do TDD? What is the key to it?
* How did it feel to program in this way? Was it easier, harder, different?
* Conventions: file names, separating the tests from the code (why?)

#### Testing Intro
<%= include_topic :tdd_intro %>

#### Demo
* <%= link_to_topic :tdd_demo %>

#### Discussion
* What do "I" do with testing in "real life"?
* Let's review some of the options in [Minitest Quick Reference](http://mattsears.com/articles/2011/12/10/minitest-quick-reference)

##### Test Data
* Sometimes known as test fixtures
* What is the role of data in developing tests for your application
* Some ways of thinking about test data
* Avoiding Brittle tests
* Mocking objects
    * Let's look at some of the code that runs this web site.
    * Note slightly different syntax because of RSpec vs. minitest/spec
    * [citem_spec.rb](https://github.com/pitosalas/curriculu/blob/master/spec/citem_spec.rb)
    * [toc_spec.rb](https://github.com/pitosalas/curriculu/blob/master/spec/toc_spec.rb)

#### Testing in Rails (if we have time)
* Principle is the same
* Remember there's no good reason to test whether Rails is doing what it is supposed to do
* For example, whether validations are validating, or whether has_many is actually working
    * Maybe a few tests to poke some holes, but certainly not each and every test.

#### Let's take a tour of all the test bits that are created for free for you in Rails
