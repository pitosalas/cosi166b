1. **Read and reflect**: Read these three articles about user interace design. What did you learn? What did you disagree with? What would you add? Do you have another, better referennce? Come up with one or two ways in which you can use these ideas to improve your product.
    * [Clean Up Your Visual Mess](http://www.visualmess.com)
    * [Principles of User Interface Design](http://bokardo.com/principles-of-user-interface-design/)
    * [Design Principles: Hierarchy](http://www.toptal.com/designers/visual/design-principles-hierarchy)
1. <%= pdfbadge %> **Stories:** Please prepare the following:
      * List of stories, prioritized, in Trello. Note that this should be your current best guess, but naturally you will be able to make changes as you go along. Remember that a story is a short description of a mini-feature. They often follow a format like "(persona) can to (action)", e.g. "Student can view a list of TAs.". Most of the time a story is one or a few sentences long. Think of it as what the programmer would what to know before trying implement the story. For example, "user can display to do list, and change the sort order either by priority or by date." You should google for product stories, or scrum stories, or writing a user story.
      * Carefully worked out schema for your product. Include table names, column names, column datatypes, primary and foreign keys, and One/Many to One/Many relatationship arrows.
      * <%= team_deliverable "pdf to the stories (printout from trello), and pdf with your schema." %>
1. <%= partbadge %> **Weekly Team Update:** Submit your <%= link_to_topic :weekly_progress_updates %> according to the instructions. <%= team_deliverable "Weekly Progress Update" %>

#### Discussion about homework for today
* I know you're all in the trenches getting *anything* to work
* What did you think of the various articles and papers? Interesting?
* Some simple lessons you learned about UI
* How will they be applicable to your products?

<%= include_topic :ux_basics %>
<%= include_topic :ux_review_exercise %>

#### Conclusion

* I want you to always refer back to principles such as these when you design or present a user experience.
* It's very easy to say, "Oh it's common sense." But you submit designs that violate these principles left and right.
* It's important. Make it part of your toolkit. Internalize it! Take care!
