1. Review <%= link_to_section :projects, :product_reviewer_meetings %>. Prepare a brief presentation

#### Presentations
* Can be semi-informal
* May or may not use slides
* Introduce team members and what they are interested in
* Describe the product as it is currently understood
* Talk about why it would make an interesting product
* Even now: try hard to explain the product in a way that someone without any context could visualize and imagine what you meen.

#### Plan for the day
* We will meet and hear about the backgrounds of each of the PRs
* Each team will have +/- 5 minutes to describe their chosen direction
* The PRs will consult and decide which two product each PR takes on
* Any remaining time will be spent with PRs and their product teams.

#### Next Class
* Look at homework <%= link_to_next_lecture %>
