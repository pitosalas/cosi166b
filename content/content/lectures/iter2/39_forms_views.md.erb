<%= homework_hdr %>

1. **Read** [Working with JavaScript in Rails](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/working_with_javascript_in_rails.html). No deliverable.
2. **Forms**: <%= zipbadge %> Investigate two very popular Form helper gems, [Formtastic](https://github.com/justinfrench/formtastic) and [SimpleForm](https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form). Challenge yourself to write a nice demo program using one of the two, displaying a very cool form. <%= deliverable "Screenshot of the form screen, and source code, zipped." %>

* [Nested Forms Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kHBIttrxVg)
