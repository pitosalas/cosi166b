### Authentication and Authorization
<%= include_topic :intro_auth %>

#### Possible implementation strategies in Rails
* Roll your own, using simple authentication. My preferred approach for this course.
* Look at other options: [Clearance](https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance) or [Sorcery]( https://github.com/Sorcery/sorcery),  [Authlogic](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/binarylogic/authlogic), or [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise)
* Look at GoRails, they have several relevant lessons: [GoRails Authentication](https://gorails.com/episodes/omniauth-twitter-sign-in?autoplay=1)
