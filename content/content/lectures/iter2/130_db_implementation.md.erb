1. <%= pdfbadge %> <%= partbadge %> **ActiveRecord Tricks Reflection:** Study this video. You will learn a lot about ActiveRecord! [ActiveRecord Tricks](https://www.driftingruby.com/episodes/activerecord-tricks). Take notes while you are watching it (its very short.) I strongly recommend you download the code from his website and follow along. Below are my very rough notes on changes you need to make so it will work. Include in your notes three things that you learned that were super cool! <%= deliverable "Your notes about problems you hit getting the tricks to work and three supercool ideas you got and how you will use them." %> 
1. <%= partbadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> **RORT:** Read [Ruby on Rails Tutorial Chapter 5](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/beginning#cha-beginning) - "Filling in the layout. Here we see how to create views, and start seeing a lot of HTML and getting into routing at a greater level of detail. As usual I really encourage and ask you to go through the code samples and actually type them in. You will see that it really helps your understanding and will assure your success in this course! Use your resources: the TAs, the class mailing list, stack overflow, google and push through to success! When you are done, go to Latte and answer these warmup questions:
    * Give me your explanation on what `link_to` is and does. As specific as you can.
    * When and why would you use a partial?
    * What does he mean (in conclusion) by a custom routing rule?
    * Are there one or two things you are still confused by? If not, what one or two things were the most memorable about your reading? <%= deliverable "Do the warmup in Latte and submit by 10am on the day of class." %>

##### Ongoing Work

* **Project Teams:** You should be up to around **STORY**
* **Rails PA 1** Working on <%= link_to_topic :pa_rails_1 %>. You can see the assigment and due dates here: <%= link_to_topic  :pa_rails_guide %>

##### My addenda on getting the tricks work:

* YMMV
* download github with code from activerecord tricks
* modify gemfile to remove ruby version line
* delete .ruby-version file from the directory
* to see hidden files `ls -la`
* rails db:seed to generate seed files
* rails console to get to the prompt for rails commands
* Status.all to see all the records in the Status table
* app/comment.rb - delete default scope
* add gem 'hirb' to gemfile; bundle
* in rails console, Hirb.enable
