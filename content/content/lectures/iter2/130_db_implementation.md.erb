1. <%= pdfbadge %> <%= partbadge %> **ActiveRecord Tricks Reflection:** Study this video. You will learn a lot about ActiveRecord! [ActiveRecord Tricks](https://www.driftingruby.com/episodes/activerecord-tricks). Take notes while you are watching it (its very short.) I strongly recommend you download the code from his website and follow along. Below are some very rough notes on changes you need to make so it will work. Include in your notes three things that you learned that were super cool! <%= deliverable "Notes about Active Record Tricks" %> 

##### Ongoing Work

* **Project Teams:** You should be up to around **STORY**
* **PA Rails 1:** Continue working on this, Due February 13. Remember, this series are pretty challenging. Please don't wait till the last minute!

#### Review
* Why Postgres?
* Here's a way to set the default of Rails to postgres:

<%= code_begin %>
# [ ~/.railsrc ]
--database=postgresql
--skip-coffee
<%= code_end %>

##### Notes on how to make ActiveRecord tricks work:

* download github with code from activerecord tricks
* modify gemfile to remove ruby version line
* delete .ruby-version file from the directory
* to see hidden files `ls -la`
* rails db:seed to generate seed files
* rails console to get to the prompt for rails commands
* Status.all to see all the records in the Status table
* app/comment.rb - delete default scope
* add gem 'hirb' to gemfile; bundle
* in rails console, Hirb.enable

<%= callout("NB", " If you don't know the schema of your app, you don't know your app!") %>
