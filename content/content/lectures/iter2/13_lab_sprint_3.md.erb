<%= homework_hdr %>
1. **Read:** Security in Rails
    * Read [Rails Security Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html)
    * Read about: [Brakeman Gem](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman)
    * Think about how this applies to your product

##### Ongoing Work
* **Projects:** You should be working on the steps up to around **URLSSDV** in <%= link_to_project :project_roadmap %>
* **Rails PA 2**: Continue working on <%= link_to_topic :pa_rails_2 %>, due Oct 20. Remember, these are pretty challenging, so please don't wait till the last minute!

### Authentication and Authorization
<%= include_topic :intro_auth %>

#### Possible implementation strategies in Rails
* Roll your own, using simple authentication. My preferred approach for this course.
* Look at other options: [Clearance](https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance) or [Sorcery]( https://github.com/Sorcery/sorcery),  [Authlogic](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/binarylogic/authlogic), or [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise)
* Look at GoRails, they have several relevant lessons: [GoRails Authentication](https://gorails.com/episodes/omniauth-twitter-sign-in?autoplay=1)
