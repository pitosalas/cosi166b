##### Ongoing Work

* **Project teams:** Even though there are no specific deliverables, you should be working on steps up to and around **SCHEMA** from <%= link_to_section :intro, :project_roadmap %>. Not just during lab and during your meetings, but on your own. Remember with a team of four (or 3 or 5) students, that's a lot of horsepower, and so we have high expectations. The sooner you kick into gear the better!
* **Rails PA 1** Working on <%= link_to_topic :pa_rails_1 %>. You can see the assigment and due dates here: <%= link_to_topic  :pa_rails_guide %>
