**Legend**: <%=partbadge%>: Participation | <%= timebadge %>: Early | <%= pdfbadge %>: PDF | <%=zipbadge %>: Zipped

1. <%= partbadge %> **Team Information**: Each team creates an entry on the [Team Information Table](https://moodle2.brandeis.edu/mod/data/view.php?id=598688), including: Product Name, TA Coach, Product Reviewer, Url to Trello, Url to your github, Url to your Heroku. <%= team_deliverable "Updated team information table entry" %>
1. <%= pdfbadge %> **Paper Prototype**: Read this paper about [Paper Prototyping](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/paperprototyping/). Design a paper prototype for your team's product.  Remember, this is an inidividual assignment, so that we can compare each team member's vision of what the product might be. We will assess your work based on the care and thought you put into it, not on whether the UI itself is awesome. <%= deliverable "Readable image of your paper prototype. If you just take a cell phone picture of a drawing in pencil (worst case) it will not be legible." %>
1. <%= partbadge %> <%= timebadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> **RORT:** Read [Ruby on Rails Tutorial (\[RORT\])](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/beginning#cha-beginning) Chapter 5, "Filling in the layout. Here we see how to create views, and start seeing a lot of HTML and getting into routing at a greater level of detail. As usual I really encourage and ask you to go through the code samples and actually type them in. You will see that it really helps your understanding and will assure your success in this course! Use your resources: the TAs, the class mailing list, stack overflow, google and push through to success! When you are done, go to Latte and answer these warmup questions:
    * Give me your explanation on what `link_to` is and does. As specific as you can.
    * When and why would you use a partial?
    * What does he mean (in conclusion) by a custom routing rule?
    * Are there one or two things you are still confused by? If not, what one or two things were the most memorable about your reading? <%= deliverable "Do the warmup in Latte and submit by 10am on the day of class." %>
1. <%= zipbadge %> **PA Rails 1:** Complete work on <%= link_to_topic :pa_rails_1 %>. Work in your portfolio, in a directory called pa_rails. Submit your code as a zip file. <%= deliverable "Rails app as a zip file." %> Begin work on <%= link_to_topic :pa_rails_2 %>, due Oct 20.
