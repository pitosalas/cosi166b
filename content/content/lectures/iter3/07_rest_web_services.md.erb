1. <%= partbadge %> <%= timebadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> **RORT:** Read [Ruby on Rails Tutorial (\[RORT\])](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/beginning#cha-beginning) Chapter 10, "Updating, Showing and Deleting Users". **YES: We skipped a chapter.** In this chapter we continue developing the big example, by adding logic to update users. Now we gradually move from authentication to authorization, which in a way is much simpler.

    As usual I really encourage and ask you to go through the code samples and actually type them in. You will see that it really helps your understanding and will assure your success in this course! Use your resources: the TAs, the class mailing list, stack overflow, google and push through to success! When you are done, go to Latte and answer these warmup questions:

    * What is a before_action? Try to be precise (but the answer can be expressed in two sentences.)
    * What does this css selector do: `.users { ...`
    * What are "strong parameters" and what is their purpose? What security risk are they meant to combat?
    * Are there one or two things you are still confused by? Code that you've written which is pure magic and meaningless to you? If not, what one or two things were the most memorable about your reading? <%= deliverable "Do the warmup in Latte and submit by 8am on the day of class." %>

1. <%= pdfbadge %> **Showcase Day Script**: Design the demo script for Showcase Day. It might seem early for this, but it is not! This script should drive the prioritization of your work over the next 6 weeks, which is all we have left before Showcase Day. You will have 8 minutes for the presentation, so the demo itself will probably only be about 5 minutes long. It needs to be carefully scripted. Take care in thinking this through! The best demo scripts "hook" the viewer with an interesting, novel bit. They also tell a story, e.g. "Let's say I've not used by bicycle in 2 years and would like to get rid of it, and maybe exchange it for something else." Your demo script is a series of bulletted steps that are meant to be followed during the demo. Meet with your team and discuss what the demo script should be and choose one of you to write it.<%= team_deliverable "Demo Script, as pdf" %>
1. **Optional** Intereting reading if you want to delve deeper:
  * [What Restful actually means](https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/five/what-restful-actually-means?__s=sp8sgb9wzgpq5zssprse)

#### Discussion

* Lets look at some Demo Scripts
* Stories
  * About being "different enough"
  * About dealing with different abilities on your team
  * What exactly will the functionality do?
  * About the Calendar
  * You cannot be coding the UI in any detail without those
  * Explain the CLI analogy
