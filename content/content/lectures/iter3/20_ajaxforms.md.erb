#### Ajax Review
* Usual process in web server
  * Browser issues an HTTP Request
  * Server responds by running action, which generates html
  * HTML is used for the response to the browser
  * Browser displays it
* Ajax process
  * Browser issues an HTTP request
  * Request is issued for remote processing
  * "In background"
  * `remote: true`
  * Server responds by running action, which generates javascript
  * Returned to the browser
  * Browser executes it
* Javascript processing
  * JS is a general purpose language
  * Browser exposes the DOM as `document.`
  * Executing js can access and modify the

#### Forms Review
* form_for, form_with, form_tag
* remote: true, default with form_with
* Think about what the submit button does:
  * for remote:true, it does a post or patch, requesting .js response
  * for remote:false, it does a post or patch, requesting .html response
  * if url was .json, it does a post or patch, requesting .json back
* How to ajaxify a form
  * **Decide precisely what you want to do**
  * Example where we change 'date updated' with ajax

#### Code Review
* Look at RailsAjaxDemo
* Look at FormsDemo for Search

#### Server Push
* Not a real term :)
* Many different ways of approaching. Sort of immature right now
* Key techniques are:
  * Periodic background polling by browser
  * WebSockets and variants which maintain an open connection to server
  * Rails 5 Action Cable
* Some links to study further:
  * New Service to support Pusher on a separate Service: [Pusher Service - free push](http://pusher.com)
  * How to use WebSockets on Heroku: [Websockets on Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ruby-websockets)
  * Rails 5 Action Cable, [YouTube Demo of Rails 5 Action Cable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0WUjGkDFS0)

* Look at FormsDemo for Pusher


#### Look at next class
* Look at homework <%= link_to_next_lecture %>
