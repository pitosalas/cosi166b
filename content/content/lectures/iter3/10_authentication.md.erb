### Review Review: resources in Rails

* Automatic wiring of plumbing between urls, routing, models, and controllers
* Takes advantage of standardized patterns
    * Nesting model in the URLs
    * CRUD operations as actions
    * Path naming (path_to_user instead of "")
    * Controller naming
* Huge time saver and bug saver!

##### Controller Actions
* Who calls the controller action?
* What parameters are supplied automatically by the controller action?
* Sessions, why they are needed and how they work
* Why does it take two separate actions to implement "create"?
* <%= link_to_topic :url %>
