* <%=partbadge%> <%= pdfbadge %> **Read and reflect**: Read several of these articles. Write a reflection, 1 page max, about which of these articels hit you the hardest, taught you the most, and perhaps which of these articles are not good and should be off this list. Secondly, how will this reading change or affect the way your product looks and works? <%= deliverable "Your personal reflection, participation only." %>

#### Project Teams midcourse progress review!
This is not actually homework but a chance to catch up if you need it. Tomorrow the TAs and I will review your progress on your product up to now. This will count as 5% of the 35% of your grade for the product. The other 30% will come through based on your work from now forward. Progress scores will be based on:

* A high level review of all the code you have so far.
* Does it appear to be going in the right direction
* Does it show an understanding of the technology
* How much of a challenge you are taking on in the project plan
* Perceptions of your TA about your project
* Preparation and actual PR meetings, as reported by PR
* How well the team seems to be functioning,

#### Discussion about homework for today
* I know you're all in the trenches getting *anything* to work
* What did you think of the various articles and papers? Interesting?
* Some simple lessons you learned about UI
* How will they be applicable to your products?

#### Conclusion

* I want you to always refer back to principles such as these when you design or present a user experience.
* It's very easy to say, "Oh it's common sense." But you submit designs that violate these principles left and right.
* It's important. Make it part of your toolkit. Internalize it! Take care!
