##### Ongoing work
* **Project teams:** Although there are no specific deliverables, you should be following <%= link_to_section :intro, :project_roadmap %>. Not just during lab and during your meetings, but on your own. Remember with a team of four (or 3 or 5) students, that's a lot of horsepower, and so we have high expectations. The sooner you kick into gear the better!
* **Rails PA 3** Begin on <%= link_to_topic :pa_rails_3 %>. You can see the assigment and due dates here: <%= link_to_topic  :pa_rails_guide %>

#### Discussion

##### Feedback from post-it note exercise

These are the big themes where maybe 5 or so students had the same points. I've published all of it on Latte and have read it all and will keep it in mind.

* People really seem to like the:
  * The comprehensiveness of course; the fact that it is highly practical and will be useful for the future as well as internships, and the way it is run
  * The course design, the structure of the web site, the outline and specific technical topics covered.
  * The PA_RAILS series despite the fact that it's hard.
  * The experience of working on a team, having to plan, learning about team dynamics, being able to pick (to a great extent) the project, and improving their team work skills
* People had concerns about
  * The amount of homework (readings and coding) required which was much greater than other courses
  * The ordering of some topics, often where the reading was too late compared to the lecture, but sometimes the other way around.
  * Grading was sometimes inconsistent; the rubric or grading criteria were not clear or well defined; sometimes the comments were too critical
  * Not having enough about the UI and the front end

#### Discussion
* Do you want to TA this course next year (if you are still at Brandeis :)
* Look at stackoverflow assignment that will be due in one week. You have to start early because there are delays!
* Reminder to self: Review resources and review single button form

#### Text Based formats / languages
* There are many
  * XML - granddaddy of them all
  * HTML - Hypertext Markup Language (HAML)
  * ERB - Embedded Ruby
  * JSON - Javascript Object Notation (YAML)
  * CSS - Cascading style sheets (SASS, SCSS, LESS)
  * Javascript - Also known as ECMAScript and EC6

* They are all like little programming languages
  * Syntax checking and syntax errors
  * Versions (HTML5, )
  * Given to 'interpreter' or 'compiler' to do something

#### Lightning Reviews
* <%= link_to_topic :xml %>
