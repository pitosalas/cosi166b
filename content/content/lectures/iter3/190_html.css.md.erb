##### Ongoing work
* **Project teams:** Although there are no specific deliverables, you should be following <%= link_to_section :intro, :project_roadmap %>. Not just during lab and during your meetings, but on your own. Remember with a team of four (or 3 or 5) students, that's a lot of horsepower, and so we have high expectations. The sooner you kick into gear the better!
* **Rails PA 3** Begin on <%= link_to_topic :pa_rails_3 %>. You can see the assigment and due dates here: <%= link_to_topic  :pa_rails_guide %>

#### Discussion
* Do you want to TA this course next year (if you are still at Brandeis :)
* Feedback from Post-it-notes
* Look at stackoverflow assignment that will be due in one week. You have to start early because there are delays!

#### Text Based formats / languages
* There are many
  * XML - granddaddy of them all
  * HTML - Hypertext Markup Language (HAML)
  * ERB - Embedded Ruby
  * JSON - Javascript Object Notation (YAML)
  * CSS - Cascading style sheets (SASS, SCSS, LESS)
  * Javascript - Also known as ECMAScript and EC6

* They are all like little programming languages
  * Syntax checking and syntax errors
  * Versions (HTML5, )
  * Given to 'interpreter' or 'compiler' to do something
