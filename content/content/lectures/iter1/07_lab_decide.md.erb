#### Let's now form Teams
* Today we will try and form teams. It will be chaotic so try and stay calm :)
* A significant part of your grade will depend on how well your team functions
* We will be doing 8 different products!

##### Rules
* Each team will have 4 students, no exceptions.
* Each team is assigned a TA as their coach
* Each team will be required to meet outside of class at least 3 hours per week

<%= callout("Previous Students Say"," \"It's tempting to just pick any old product and just move on. Not a good idea! You might regret that later. You will be spending a lot lot of time with the choice, so it's worth choosing with care.\"") %>

#### First Team Meeting in class
* Get to know each other a little
* Begin thinking about your weekly meeting time
* Discuss what interests the team most about this product
* You can also refer to <%= link_to_project :project_roadmap %> for some further background details
