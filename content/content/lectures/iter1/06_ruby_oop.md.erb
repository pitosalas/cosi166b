1. **PROD:** Meet outside of class for at least 1 hour with 1-2 other students. Your mission is to come up with improvements or new product ideas. I know it's hard to find time, but really try to do it so you can really get a feel of where you could take each idea. Write up your favorite two or three ideas as entries in the [Product Ideas List](https://moodle2.brandeis.edu/mod/data/view.php?id=598092) in Latte.  It doesn't matter if the others in your team of three write up the same. However write them down independently! <%= deliverable "Write up your personal favorite 2-3 ideas. Also, comment on one or two other students project ideas." %>
