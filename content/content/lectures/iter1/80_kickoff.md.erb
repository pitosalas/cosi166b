1. <%= partbadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> <%= teambadge %> **Product Teams Kickoff:** Each team (and all team members) meet for at  1-2 hours to discuss and decide on their direction. Here are some specifics and topics to discuss
    * Confirm team members. 
    * Decide on specific weekly meeting time. Treat it with the seriousness that you would a class commitment. 
    * Discuss and decide the product you want to build. It's ok to change things around so everyone is satisfied.
    * Continue refining your idea and trying to make sure you are all in agreement on the direction. 
    * Consider what interests the team most about this product. 
    * What is "Hello World" functionality you want? (You can also refer to <%= link_to_section :intro, :project_roadmap %> for some further background details.) 
    * <%= team_deliverable "Summary of the result of the meeting." %>
2. **PA Rails 1:** Begin work on <%= link_to_topic :pa_rails_1 %>. This will be due in about 10 days. It is fairly challenging so please look at it now.

<%= callout("Alert:", " The series of PA Rails assignments (there are three) are pretty hard. You should not wait till the last minute!") %>

#### General Notes

##### Hello World!
* One of the principles of Agile development is to have running code as soon as possible and all the time
* Sometime in 2 or so weeks you will have completed your "Hello World" version of the product
* It might show one or two screens that does one little thing with a database with just one or two tables.
* It's purpose is to prove that you've gotten *something* running.
* Let's take a look at <%= link_to_topic :mini_scrum %>

##### Term Project
* Instead of a final, this course will have a Showcase day where everyone presents and demos their products
* You will need to plan out what you want to have working on that day
  * Think of this as the absolute minimum demo of your product that you want to have working by the product showcase.
  * What is the essential coolness of your product? Can you demo that?
  * Remember a perfect login or user settings page is not essential coolness.
  * Think of the aha reaction you want in the viewer.
  * Remember you can always exceed that!
* Narrow your focus!
  * You will make a detailed mockup/paper prototype of your 1 or at most 2 core views your 1.0 will require
  * Detailed not because it has beautiful colors but because it covers the layout AND interactions that will work.
  * Everything from here on should be support that core view and nothing more!
  * Divide and conquer! Make sure each team member has a distinct deliverable!
  * Dig into the difficult things - don't avoid them in favor of the easy things!
