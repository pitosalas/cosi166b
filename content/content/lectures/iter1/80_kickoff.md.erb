1. <%= pdfbadge %> **Product Teams Kickoff and Presentation:** Each team meets for at least 2 hours to discuss and decide on their direction. Here are some specifics and topics to discuss
    * Confirm team members. 
    * Decide on specific weekly meeting time. Treat it with the seriousness that you would a class commitment. 
    * Discuss and decide the product you want to build. It's ok to change things around so everyone is satisfied.
    * Continue refining your idea and trying to make sure you are all in agreement on the direction. 
    * Consider what interests the team most about this product. 
    * What functionality the SDV might have (see <%= link_to_project :product_plan_of_attack %>) should contain. (You can also refer to <%= link_to_project :project_roadmap %> for some further background details.) 
    * Prepare a brief 5 minute presentation, powerpoint (or equivalent). It can be informal.
    * **make sure** one of you can describe the product concept clearly so the PRs understand it.
    * <%= team_deliverable "Powerpoint for the 5 minute presentation." %>
2. **PA Rails 1:** Begin work on <%= link_to_topic :pa_rails_1 %>. This will be due in about 10 days. It is fairly challenging so please look at it now.

<%= callout("Alert:", " The series of PA Rails assignments (there are three) are pretty hard. You should not wait till the last minute!") %>
