* <%= codebadge %> **RTHW**:  Continue with RHW: [Learn Ruby The Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/preface.html). You should be at least up to Lesson 40 where you will learn about working with files. I know it's going fast, but we are trying to get up the learning curve quickly. The lessons are getting a lot more difficult, arent they? Don't give up or start slacking, keep at it! Remember that your work should be happening inside your <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %>.
* <%=partbadge%> <%= pdfbadge %> **Products**: Come up with a few product ideas. For inspiration you could look at <%= link_to_project :prod_candidates %> or the [Student product showcase](http://pitosalas.github.io/brandeisprojects/) or [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com). It doesn't matter where. Select between one and three that you might want to work on in this class. Remember the caveat: Don't set the bar at "this is the most wonderful product idea I ever saw". Set it at "this is a product that could be interesting to develop and work on." Write up (in 1 or two paragraphs) your favorite product ideas! <%= deliverable("Submit your report as a pdf to Latte.") %>
* <%= zipbadge %> **PA_MOVIES_1**: Complete <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_1 %>. This assignment will get you to write some basic code with Ruby. You will learn how to read files work with data in arrays and hashes. If you are stuck, ask one of our wonderful TAs for assistance. Up to now you have been coding inside your own <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %>. <%= deliverable "Your PA1 submission, zipped." %>
