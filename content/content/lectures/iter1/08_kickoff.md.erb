* <%= zipbadge %> **Movies_2**: Complete <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_2 %> Look closely at the end of <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_2 %> where two deliverables are specified. <%= deliverable "Upload your code to github; run it through Codeclimate; write a post with the requested information about your solution. Zip up the directory and submit it to Latte" %>
* **Kanban:** Kanban is one of the easiest forms of Agile planning to implement so we will be using that for our projects. You can find lots and lots of information about Kanban on the web. I selected this article about [The Kanban methodology](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban) to read, but you are welcome to look further. Also Watch this [Video about implementing Kanban with Trello](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrNbc8BwqRU
). In discussion as a team, one of you create the Trello board you will use for your project and add all your ideas and preliminary tasks to it. Begin tying names to Kanban cards.
