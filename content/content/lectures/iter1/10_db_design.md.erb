1. **PA Rails 1:** Begin work on <%= link_to_topic :pa_rails_1 %>.  The series of PA Rails assignments (there are three) will be a rock solid review of what you're learning from RORT. They are hard. You should not wait till the last minute!This will be due on TBD.

1. <%= pdfbadge %> **Schema**: Develop an initial schema for your product. Read [Basics of good database design in Web Development](http://www.onextrapixel.com/2011/03/17/the-basics-of-good-database-design-in-web-development/). You might google around for other sources if you like. You need to think clearly about the functionality that your system will support. You also need to think carefully about relationships.

	For example, let's say I have a Student entity and I have a Course entity. Is there exactly one student for every course (1 to 1). Are there many students for any one course (many to 1) or perhaps does one student have many courses (1 to many), or maybe even a combination - one student can have many courses, and one course can have many students - (many to many). Don't even start worrying about designing your database until you have questions like that clear in your mind!

	Using all that background, develop initial schema for your product. Each team member work separately so you can then compare and contrast what you came up with. So this is an individual assignment! Include table names, field or attribute names, and relations or joins. Please use this exact format: <%= link_to_topic :simple_schema_notation %> <%= deliverable "Initial schema for your product. As a pdf file generated any way you want. Include your name and hw number!" %>
1. **Project teams:** Even though there are no specific deliverables, you should be working on steps **GIT, DOCUMENTATION, PLANSKEL, BUILDSKEL, SHEMASKEL, SCHEMASDV** from <%= link_to_project :project_roadmap %>. Not just during lab and during your meetings, but on your own. Remember with a team of four (or 3 or 5) students, that's a lot of horsepower, and so we have high expectations. The sooner you kick into gear the better!

#### Review Homework
* Discuss some exemplar Schemas that were designed
* About PR Meetings on Thursday
  * Nice job on presentations everyone
  * How will PR scheduling work exactly


#### Relational Databases and Object Oriented Software
* What does an ORM do?
* "Impendance misatch"
* The "ActiveRecord" Object Oriented Pattern
	* Wraps records *you are working on* inside an object of the Active Record pattern
	* **Not** every record in the database, just what the code is working on at one time or another
* The Rails Activerecord layer
* What is the relationship between the underlying DB and the AR objects
