<%= callout("NB", " The Tutorial uses Cloud9 but you should NOT use Cloud9. Install things on your own laptop.") %>

1. <%= partbadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> **RORT:** Read [Ruby on Rails Tutorial (\[RORT\])](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/beginning#cha-beginning). Read Chapter 1. Make sure you look at <%= link_to_topic :railstutorial_notes %> for some critical information. It's a long chapter but you will learn A LOT! It has lots of useful information that you will use now or refer to in the future. You should do the steps that he shows in the chapter yourself. You will hit snags, but push forward until you get it all done. Now go to Latte and answer these warmup questions:
    * Can you come up with an original example of when you would use a git branch?
    * What is the difference between git and githhub?
    * What is the difference between Heroku and Github?
    * What problem does bundler solve?
    * Are there one or two things you are still confused by? If not, what one or two things were the most memorable about your reading?
    * <%= deliverable "Do the warmup in Latte and submit as a pdf." %>
2. <%= partbadge %> **PROD:** Meet outside of class for at least 1 hour with 1-2 other students, look through and discuss the project options. You may use some of the ideas you wrote up on Tuesday, or again refer to all these sources: <%= link_to_topic :product_inspirations %>.
    These are not necessarily going to be your teammates. It's just a forum to immerse yourelf in the project ideas and exchange ideas. Discuss discuss discuss. I know it's hard to find time, but really try to do it so you can really get a feel of where you could take each idea. Write up your favorite two or three ideas as separate entries in the [Product Ideas](https://moodle2.brandeis.edu/mod/forum/view.php?id=1046517) in Latte.  It doesn't matter if the others in your team of three write up the same. However write them down independently! <%= deliverable "Write up your personal favorite 2-3 ideas in the product ideas list. Also, comment on one or two other students project ideas there. No need to submit a pdf!" %>
1. <%= zipbadge %> **Movies_1**: Complete <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_1 %>. <%= deliverable "Zipped up source code for your solution." %>
1. **Movies 2**: Begin working on <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_2 %>. This ruby project builds on <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_1 %>. Using the same data set now you will augment your statistics and predictive logic, and finally test how well your algorithm can predict what a certain user will like to see. Don't get too carried away with a very clever predictive algorithm. Previous students have found that a super simplistic algorithm (at least in this assignment) works almost as well as the fanciest one you can come up with.

##### Interesting (optional) Reading
* [Mastering Bash and Terminal](https://www.blockloop.io/mastering-bash-and-terminal?utm_source=hackernewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=fav)
* [Learn Enough Command Line to be Dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial) seems to be a very nice resource.

#### Discussion about homework
* Let's hear about chapter 1
* Let's look at PA_MOVIES_1. Who will volunteer for a live discussion about your code?
* Questions about <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_2 %>

#### Important differences from the book!
* We will not be using Cloud9 but instead working on our own computers
* Unless you've hit unsurmountable problems on your own computer (discuss)
* We will be using Postgres database on both our local computer and when we deploy

#### Ruby Live Coding Demonstration and discussion
* <%= link_to_topic :classes_tut %>
* <%= link_to_topic :inheritance_tut %>

<%= include_topic :classes_objects_polymorphism %>
<%= include_topic :duck_typing %>
<%= include_topic :software_design %>

#### Next Class
* Look at homework: <%= link_to_next_lecture %>
