You can find lots and lots of information about Kanban on the web. Read: [A Beginnerâ€™s Guide To Managing Software Development with Kanban and Trello](https://www.toptal.com/agile/guide-managing-development-kanban-trello?utm_campaign=blog_post_guide_managing_development_kanban_trello&utm_medium=email&utm_source=blog_subscribers). Also Watch this [Video about implementing Kanban with Trello](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrNbc8BwqRU
). In discussion as a team, one of you create the Trello board you will use for your project and add all your ideas and preliminary tasks to it. Begin tying names to Kanban cards. <%= team_deliverable "Report describing your meeting about Kanban including a link to your Trello board" %>
