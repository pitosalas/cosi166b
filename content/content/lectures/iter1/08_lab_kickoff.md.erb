1. **Kanban:** Kanban is one of the easiest forms of Agile planning to implement so we will be using that for our projects. You can find lots and lots of information about Kanban on the web.

<%= callout("Previous Students Say"," \"It's tempting to just pick any old product and just move on. Not a good idea! You might regret that later. You will be spending a lot lot of time with the choice, so it's worth choosing with care.\"") %>

#### First Team Meeting
* Each team meets for at least 90 minutes to discuss and decide on their direction.
* Confirm team members. Decide on specific weekly meeting time.
<%= callout("Time", " Scheduling a standing meeting time is hard. But it is required and expected. Please be flexible with your teammates and find a time that is the least inconvenient!") %>
* Discuss and decide the product you want to build.
* What interests the team most about this product.
* You can also refer to <%= link_to_project :project_roadmap %> for some further background details
