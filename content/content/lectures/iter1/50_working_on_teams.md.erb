1. **Working in Teams** Read the "Working In Teams" section, right below this. Last time I got feedback from the teams that they would have liked more help in being effective as a team. I would like your personal feedback on what I wrote. Is this all common sense? Have you already had lots of experience working in teams? Did you see anything that you really disagreed with? Name one or two things that you would like to learn more about, didn't understand, or found particularly interesting. Are you prepared to use these techniques? No deliverable
1. <%= partbadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> **RORT:** Read [Ruby on Rails Tutorial (\[RORT\])](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/beginning#cha-beginning) Chapter 2. Look at <%= link_to_topic :railstutorial_notes %> for late breaking addenta and errata. This is going to be another exciting chapter. Don't worry if a lot of things seem "magic", as the classes continue it will all become crystal clear to you! For this chapter you are going to create a toy application. Make sure you understand what the app is trying to do and actually follow along. I strongly recommend that you type in the code just like what he says in the book because from my experience youy will learn a lot more that way. You will use the `rails` command and the `rake` command as part of your development process. You will for the first time start the process of understanding really how a web server actually works! Take your time and see if you can make it all the way to the end and get it all to work. You will hit snags. Use your resources: the TAs the class mailing list, stack overflow, google and push through to success! When you are done, go to Latte and answer these warmup questions:

    * What is a url and what role does it play in the MVC architecture and the basic operation of a web server?
    * What job does a `view` and a `model` do in the MVC architecture?
    * Complete this sentence: "Rails is ..."
    * The chapter talks about "deploying" the rails application. What do you think that means?
    * Are there one or two things you are still confused by? If not, what one or two things were the most memorable about your reading? <%= deliverable "Do the warmup in Latte and submit as a pdf." %>
