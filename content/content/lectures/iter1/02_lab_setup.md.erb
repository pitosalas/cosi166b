1. <%= partbadge %> Begin working on <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_1 %>. This assignment will get you to write and thereby get to know Ruby. You will learn how to read files work with data in arrays and hashes. Remember that your work should be happening inside your <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %>.
1. <%= partbadge %> Continue with [Learn Ruby The Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/preface.html). Your success in the whole course will be strongly affected by how comfortable you get with Ruby. It's a really fun and interesting language.You should be at least up to Lesson 22 where you will learn about working with files. You should be up to Lesson Remember that your work should be happening inside your <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %>

#### Computer Setup
* Make sure you have installed:
	* Ruby 2.4
	* Rails 5.1
	* git
* If you have a Mac, install
	* Homebrew
	* rbenv

#### Portfolio Discussion
Other than your products (which will start in a few weeks) all your coding on homework assignments will be submitted through your <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %>.

#### Programming Assignments

* Review exactly what <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_1 %> is about. Answer questions.

#### Github open play instructions
* Notes about Git and Github: <%= link_to_topic :git %>

1. Everyone sign up to a free Github account
1. Make sure you know your github username and password
1. Locate the **HTTPS clone URL** (not the SSH url) within here: https://github.com/Cosi-166/my-play-project
1. Everyone clone this repo to your top level portfolio directory: [my-play-project](https://github.com/Cosi-166/my-play-project): `git clone https:\\xxxx`
1. Change to the directory that was created by git clone (`my-play-project`)
1. Run your text editor and create a file and put some text into it
1. Check the status of your repo (`git status`)
1. Add that new file to the staging area for git (`git add`)
1. Now with that one change, create a new git commit (`git commit`)
1. Your local copy of the repo now has one more commit than the server had
1. But notice that all your classmates are doing the same, so, there may already be some more commits on the server. So just to make sure, pull the state down of the repo which is on the server. (`git pull`)
1. Now push your repo (and all its commits) to the server (`git push`)
1. Double check what the state of your local repo is (`git status`)
1. Now locate a file that you didn't create, and make a change to it using your text editor.
1. Follow the same steps above to send that change up to the server
1. Continue to play and play and play
