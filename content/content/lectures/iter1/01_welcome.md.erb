<%= callout("Note for first day of class:", " Each day of class has a page on this web site. The first section of that page is always the homework due on that very day. So in other words, the homework listed here is actually 'pre-work' for day one. We will go over this in a little more detail during class.") %>

1. Complete the requirements of the <%= link_to_background :required_preparation %>. This specifically applies to students who are using Windows computers. If you are on Linux or Macintosh, then you are all set.

1. Locate and begin or continue going through [Learn Ruby The Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/). You will be responsible for Exercise 1-44 over the next week and a half. You will then have to do and submit Exercise 45 as homework. You should complete at least to Exercise 16 by today.

1. Study the requirements for the first programming assignment: <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_1 %>. You will be using what you've learned about programming in your previous courses. Yes, it's a new language, but really the basic ideas are exactly the same. We are working on problem solving as much as anything. Come ready to discuss the approach you will take in class. If you've already done this in Cosi105 then I have something very special for you!

#### Homework Logistics
* Yes there's a fair bit of homework
* You are responsible for reading the page for the days's lecture and locating the homeworks.
* Latte is used **just** as a way to submit homeworks

<%= callout("Student Quote", " \"Pay close attention to this. It's not complicated if you do. Still, almost everyone got it wrong the first few times.\" ") %>

* Some homeworks will have explicit deliverables:
   * They are clearly marked as "deliverable" or "team deliverable"
   * They are idenfitied as X.Y where X is the lecture number and Y is the homework for this lecture.
   * <%= nb("Always Always submit them as pdfs!!! (unless its code, in which case as a .zip)") %>
   * <%= nb("Always Always! include your name and the homework number at the top of the page!") %>

#### Projects

* Projects are at the core of this course!
* We will form teams of three or four students.
* Teams will be formed in collaboration between me and the students.
* Let's look at what it's like to <%= link_to_topic :working_in_teams %>
* Each team will be building a product! I will help you find one!
