1. <%= pdfbadge %> **Working in Teams** Read the "Working In Teams" section, right below this. Last time I got feedback from the teams that they would have liked more help in being effective as a team. I would like your personal feedback on what I wrote. Is this all common sense? Have you already had lots of experience working in teams? Did you see anything that you really disagreed with? Name one or two things that you would like to learn more about, didn't understand, or found particularly interesting. Are you prepared to use these techniques? <%= deliverable "Brief response to the writeup addressing these or other questions." %>
1. **Movies 2**: Begin working on <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_2 %>. This ruby project builds on <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_1 %>. Using the same data set now you will augment your statistics and predictive logic, and finally test how well your algorithm can predict what a certain user will like to see. Don't get too carried away with a very clever predictive algorithm. Previous students have found that a super simplistic algorithm (at least in this assignment) works almost as well as the fanciest one you can come up with.
