1. <%= zipbadge %> **RTHW:** Finish with [Learn Ruby The Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/preface.html) up and including Lesson 45. You will learn about the wonders of arrays and hashes. Also one of the more advanced ruby features, modules. And now you start getting into somewhat more abstract stuff, object oriented analysis and design. Remember that your scratch work should be happening inside your <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %>. <%= deliverable "Code from RTHW last exercise, zipped" %>

1. **Movies2**: Begin working on <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_2 %>. It's a continuation of movies_1. It will be due soon! As usual, you please do your coding in your <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %>. Start a new top level directory for this called "movies-2".
