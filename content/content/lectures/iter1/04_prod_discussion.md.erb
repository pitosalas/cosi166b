1. <%= partbadge %> <%= timebadge %> **RORT:** Read [Ruby on Rails Tutorial (\[RORT\])](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/beginning#cha-beginning). Read Chapter 1. We all set up our local ruby and rails environments, so you should ignore all the bits about Cloud9, section 1.2.1. But the chapter has lots of other useful information that you will use now or refer to in the future. You should do the steps that he shows in the chapter yourself. You will hit snags, but push forward until you get it all done. Now go to Latte and answer these warmup questions:

    * Can you come up with an original example of when you would use a git branch?
    * What is the difference between git and githhub?
    * What is the difference between Heroku and Github?
    * What problem does bundler solve?
    * Are there one or two things you are still confused by? If not, what one or two things were the most memorable about your reading? <%= deliverable "Do the warmup in Latte and submit by 8am on the day of class." %>

2. <%= pdfbadge %> **PROD:** Meet outside of class for at least 1 hour with 3 other students, look through and discuss the project options. These are not necessarily going to be your teammates. It's just a forum to immerse yourelf in the project ideas and exchange ideas. Discuss discuss discuss. I know it's hard to find time, but really try to do it so you can really get a feel of where you could take each idea. <%= deliverable "Write up your personal favorite 2-3 ideas. It doesn't matter if the others in your team of three write up the same. However write them down independently." %>

### Cosi166b (cocktail-free) cocktail party
* For the next 30-45 minutes we will mingle and network
* Your job right now will be to talk to as many people as you can
* **Don't ask:**
  * "Whats your major"
  * "What dorm are you in",
  * "What courses are you taking?"
  * "How was your summer?"
  * or other "How's the weather"-type questions.
* **Do ask:**
  * One thing about you that almost no one at Brandeis knows
  * What are you passionate about?
  * What outside projects do you have?

#### First product selection discussion
* I will ask the groups of 3 to talk about what products they liked. Give your names!
* Sales pitches for products (Pito and any other students)
* How close to the writeup will the product have to be?
* Do we have to use ruby on rails? (yes)
* Write ideas on the board as fast as we can!

<%= callout("Our Goal", " Post about 20 product ideas in the Latte Product Ideas forum during class.") %>
