1. <%= partbadge %> <%= timebadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> **RORT:** Read [Ruby on Rails Tutorial (\[RORT\])](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/beginning#cha-beginning). Read Chapter 1. Look at <%= link_to_topic :rails51_notes %> for late breaking addenta and errata. It's a long chapter but you will learn A LOT! It has lots of useful information that you will use now or refer to in the future. You should do the steps that he shows in the chapter yourself. You will hit snags, but push forward until you get it all done. Now go to Latte and answer these warmup questions:

    * Can you come up with an original example of when you would use a git branch?
    * What is the difference between git and githhub?
    * What is the difference between Heroku and Github?
    * What problem does bundler solve?
    * Are there one or two things you are still confused by? If not, what one or two things were the most memorable about your reading?
    * <%= deliverable "Do the warmup in Latte and submit by 10am on the day of class." %>

2. <%= pdfbadge %> **PROD:** Meet outside of class for at least 1 hour with 1-2 other students, look through and discuss the project options. These are not necessarily going to be your teammates. It's just a forum to immerse yourelf in the project ideas and exchange ideas. Discuss discuss discuss. I know it's hard to find time, but really try to do it so you can really get a feel of where you could take each idea. Write up your favorite two or three ideas as entries in the [Product Ideas List](https://moodle2.brandeis.edu/mod/data/view.php?id=598092) in Latte.  It doesn't matter if the others in your team of three write up the same. However write them down independently! <%= deliverable "Write up your personal favorite 2-3 ideas in the product ideas list. Also, comment on one or two other students project ideas there." %>
