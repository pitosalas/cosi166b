1. **Team PR Pre-discussion**: Each team has to prepare for the meeting with the PRs. Continue refining your idea and trying to make sure you are all in agreement on the direction. Also, prepare a brief presentation for the PRs:
  * Plan to talk for no more than 5 minutes per project. Less is ok too.
  * **make sure** one of you can describe the product concept clearly so the PRs understand it.
  * Show whatever you have already on the product's design, for example the list of features, sketches of the home page, idas about the architecture. Whatever you have.
  * Slides are not required (but are certainly ok if it helps you)
  * **make sure** Prepare a one page summary of the above information and print around 10 copies.
