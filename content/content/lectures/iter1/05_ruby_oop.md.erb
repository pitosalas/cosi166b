1. **Movies 2**: Begin working on <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_2 %>. This ruby project builds on <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_1 %>. Using the same data set now you will augment your statistics and predictive logic, and finally test how well your algorithm can predict what a certain user will like to see. Don't get too carried away with a very clever predictive algorithm. Previous students have found that a super simplistic algorithm (at least in this assignment) works almost as well as the fanciest one you can come up with.
1. **RTHW:** Finish with [Learn Ruby The Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/preface.html) up and including Lesson 42.
