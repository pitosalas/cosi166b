1. <%= pdfbadge %> <%= partbadge %> **Working in Teams** Read the "Working In Teams" section, right below this. Last time I got feedback from the teams that they would have liked more help in being effective as a team. I would like your personal feedback on what I wrote. Is this all common sense? Have you already had lots of experience working in teams? Did you see anything that you really disagreed with? Name one or two things that you would like to learn more about, didn't understand, or found particularly interesting. Are you prepared to use these techniques? <%= deliverable "Brief response to the writeup addressing these or other questions." %>
1. <%= pdfbadge %> <%= partbadge %> **PROD:** Meet outside of class for at least 1 hour with 1-2 other students. Your mission is to come up with improvements or new product ideas. I know it's hard to find time, but really try to do it so you can really get a feel of where you could take each idea. Write up your favorite two or three ideas as entries in the [Product Ideas List](https://moodle2.brandeis.edu/mod/data/view.php?id=598092) in Latte.  It doesn't matter if the others in your team of three write up the same. However write them down independently! <%= deliverable "Write up your personal favorite 2-3 ideas. Also, comment on one or two other students project ideas." %>
1. **PA Movies 2**: Continue working on <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_2 %>. It's not super easy so don't wait till the last minute!
1. **As I see myself**Do the <%= link_to_topic :asiseemyself %> profile. Here's the link [to the As I see myself profile pdf](https://moodle2.brandeis.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=623214)
