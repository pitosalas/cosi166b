1. **Team Prep**: Each team prepares a powerpoint (or equivalent) presentation. Continue refining your idea and trying to make sure you are all in agreement on the direction. During this meeting the TA Partners will be assigned.

    * Plan to talk for no more than 5 minutes per project.
    * Can be semi-informal; may but doesnt need to use slides
    * Introduce team members and what they are interested in
    * **make sure** one of you can describe the product concept clearly so the PRs understand it.
    * Show whatever you have already on the product's design, for example the list of features, sketches of the home page, idas about the architecture.
    * Slides are not required (but are certainly ok if it helps you)
    * Talk about why it would make an interesting product
    * Prepare a one page summary of the above information and print around 10 copies.

1. **Rails PA 1**: Continue working on <%= link_to_topic :pa_rails_1 %>
