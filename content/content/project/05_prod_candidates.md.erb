#### Intro

Here is the list of the officially "approved" product ideas. We are not focused in this class on whether the product will make a billion dollars or will be super useful. The products on this list are all buildable within the semester and are all interesting for one reason or another.

The product descriptions are fairly vague so they leave you a lot of room to fill in the blank spaces. However for this course we will not be inventing new products from blank pieces of paper because that would take just too much time.

I don't claim these product are unique, never heard of before or even a good idea. This list is here to inspire your thinking and take you out of your usual comfort zone!

#### The List
