title: Proposing a Product
---
As you know, a central part of this course and lab is the development of a product, working in a team with 3 other students. We will have a brainstorming process when we can all kick around ideas. A template is provided for you to submit an idea that you think would be awesome for a team to work on. The signs of a good proposal are:

1. How clearly defined and understood is the product?
1. How feasible is it to be developed during one semester?
1. How committed is the proposer to the product?

#### Product Proposal Template

* **Proposer:** \[your name\]

* **Product name:** \[This can be anything you want. Sometimes people just pick a code name like Alpha, and sometimes a descriptive name like  Affective Tutor. You can always change it later.\]
