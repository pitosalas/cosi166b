## Notes from experience teaching in Spring 2017

* add a significant new amount of javascript
* space out the PARails 1,2,3 so that they match better with the material
* look closely at balancing of homeworks so that they don't clump together
* look closely at adding justifications to homework assignments
* add a little more and structured stuff about agile
* make sure the cocktail hour is there
* Maybe ask Jen Cleary to do some kind of teaming workshop during one of the early classes


* Here are two examples of lectures with too many and too confusing assignments:

## Notes from Fall 2017
* At the beginning of the semester show off some past project demos
* Move more part only work to end because thats when they are most busy
* Assignment: make sure you don't ask for something youve not covered yet.
* Beware of last minute homework changes. Post to Latte no less than 1 week before
* Make sure you dont put API key into github
* Practice on how to learn things
  * Start early to be able to ask questions
  * Google it
  * Use Stack Overflow
  * Youtube videos
  * Tutorials
