## Notes from experience teaching in 2017

* add a significant new amount of javascript
* space out the PARails 1,2,3 so that they match better with the material
* look closely at balancing of homeworks so that they don't clump together
* look closely at adding justifications to homework assignments
* add a little more and structured stuff about agile
* make sure the cocktail hour is there
* Maybe ask Jen Cleary to do some kind of teaming workshop during one of the early classes


* Here are two examples of lectures with too many and too confusing assignments:
